# Constellations of Characters and Dramaturgical Structures: 
## A Computational Analysis of Ludvig Holberg's Comedies
This reporsitory holds code used for the research article Constellations of Characters and Dramaturgical Structures: A Computational Analysis of Ludvig Holberg's Comedies by Ulla Kallenbach and Anna Lawaetz. 

The code was original created for the pilot project "Danish theater archives in the digital era in research and teaching". The project was funded by the Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation’s and Royal Danish Library’s National Cultural Heritage Cluster and developed by the authors in collaboration with PI Annelis Kuhlmann (Aarhus University) and Birthe Aagesen (Centre for Educational Development, Aarhus University).   
Codes were developed by Per Møldrup Dalum and Bolette Jurik (Royal Danish Library). The project was subsequently further developed in collaboration with Centre for Humanities Computing, Aarhus University, funded by ARTS Aarhus University.  
Max Odsbjerg Pedersen (Royal Danish Library) has done additional coding for this repository..
